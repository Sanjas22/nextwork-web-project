# DevOps Challenge: Overview

## Introduction:

The 7-Day DevOps Challenge is a structured learning experience aimed at building a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services. This project covers key DevOps principles such as cloud deployment, version control, security, automation, and infrastructure management. By the end, a complete DevOps workflow is established, ensuring efficient development and deployment processes.

## Project Summary:

The challenge starts with setting up a cloud environment for hosting applications, followed by integrating Git and GitHub for version control. Security measures are implemented by managing dependencies with AWS CodeArtifact. The next step involves continuous integration using AWS CodeBuild, automating the build and testing processes. The deployment phase leverages AWS CodeDeploy to ensure smooth and automated application rollouts. To enhance scalability and efficiency, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is introduced with AWS CloudFormation. Finally, all the components are integrated into a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, enabling seamless code delivery from development to production.

## Technologies Used:

AWS Services: EC2, CodeArtifact, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, CodePipeline
Version Control: Git & GitHub
CI/CD Tools: Automated build, test, and deployment services

## Key Learnings:

Cloud Application Deployment: Hosting and managing applications on AWS.
Version Control & Collaboration: Efficiently tracking and managing code with Git & GitHub.
Continuous Integration & Deployment: Automating build, test, and deployment workflows.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automating cloud infrastructure provisioning.
